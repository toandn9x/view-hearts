# Zefoy - Free TikTok Views Automation
**Zefoy** is a powerful tool that enhances your TikTok views effortlessly through the Termux application. By leveraging the services of [zefoy.com](https://zefoy.com), Zefoy enables you to rapidly and efficiently boost your TikTok view count, making it easier to increase your video visibility.

With Zefoy, you can achieve between 1,000 to 2,000 TikTok views in just 5 minutes, making it an invaluable asset for anyone looking to enhance their presence on TikTok quickly and effectively!

## Features
Zefoy offers a range of features designed to enhance your TikTok experience, including free TikTok views that can be obtained quickly and efficiently. Additionally, Zefoy utilizes advanced captcha bypass technology, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted experience by automatically processing and extracting captcha text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques with the pytesseract library.

## Installation
To get started with Zefoy, first ensure that you have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_1020.apk) application installed. Then, follow the commands below to install and set up Zefoy:
```
$ pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip tesseract
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/Zefoy.git
$ cd "Zefoy"
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```


## Troubleshooting
To ensure Zefoy works optimally, make sure your TikTok account is public and use the correct video link. Copy the link directly from the TikTok app or website to avoid errors.

If you encounter an error while sending views, try enabling airplane mode to refresh your connection. Check if the Zefoy server is down or undergoing maintenance. Also, double-check that the video link you entered is accurate.

Login issues are often caused by Zefoy’s security systems, such as captcha challenges or Cloudflare protection, which may temporarily block access.

Regarding view counts, you can typically receive over 1000 views within 4-10 minutes. However, if the server is busy, the number of views delivered may be reduced.

If your TikTok views suddenly drop, it could be due to TikTok detecting suspicious activity, a bug in Zefoy, or restrictions imposed by TikTok's security system. Keep in mind that delays or failures in delivering views may occur if there are issues with the Zefoy platform.

## Warning
Using Zefoy to increase TikTok views comes with risks, including the potential violation of TikTok’s terms of service. Excessive use may result in penalties such as account suspension or banning. Always use this tool responsibly and ensure your actions comply with TikTok’s rules and legal guidelines to avoid any negative consequences.
