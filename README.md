## Troubleshooting
To ensure Zefoy works optimally, make sure your TikTok account is public and use the correct video link. Copy the link directly from the TikTok app or website to avoid errors. Valid examples include `https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNVTS1eE/` or `https://www.tiktok.com/@rozhak.sch.id/video/7311522299532840198`.

If you encounter an error while sending views, try enabling airplane mode to refresh your connection. Check if the Zefoy server is down or undergoing maintenance. Also, double-check that the video link you entered is accurate.

Login issues are often caused by Zefoy’s security systems, such as captcha challenges or Cloudflare protection, which may temporarily block access.

Regarding view counts, you can typically receive over 1000 views within 4-10 minutes. However, if the server is busy, the number of views delivered may be reduced.

If your TikTok views suddenly drop, it could be due to TikTok detecting suspicious activity, a bug in Zefoy, or restrictions imposed by TikTok's security system. Keep in mind that delays or failures in delivering views may occur if there are issues with the Zefoy platform.
